# IBM Maximo Asset Management overview

IBM® Maximo® Asset Management is an integrated productivity tool and
database that helps you manage all of your asset types on a single software
platform. Built on a service-oriented architecture (SOA), Maximo Asset
Management delivers you a comprehensive view of all asset types, their
conditions and locations, and the work processes that support them, to provide
you with optimal planning, control, audit, and compliance capability.
The Maximo database provides critical information about asset resources,
including key attributes, their configuration, and their physical and logical
relationships to other resources.
By using the Maximo Asset Management user interface, you can establish key
performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor asset conditions and trigger automated
action based on changes. You can create, assign, monitor, notify, and report on key
process components such as work orders, service desk tickets, and purchase
orders, including status, from start to finish. You can also include attachments,
such as maps, pictures, and URLs to each record or task to further enhance
communication and productivity.
Maximo Asset Management lets you manage end-to-end asset operations and
business processes to deliver efficient and effective services aligned with your
business goals. It provides a comprehensive and modular approach to integrated
asset control and visibility by providing an enterprise platform for storing
standardized data on asset histories to help integrate people, processes,
information, and technology. Maximo Asset Management offerings include tools,
best practices, and service offerings for incremental value. Managing assets
through Maximo Asset Management gives your business a competitive
advantage.
